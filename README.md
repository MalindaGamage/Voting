# Voting Eligibility and History Calculator

This C# Console application calculates the number of presidential elections in which you could have voted based on your current age. It's a simple, yet insightful tool that highlights your potential participation in the democratic process over the years.

## Features
* Age Input: Promptly asks for your current age to determine your voting eligibility.
* Eligibility Check: Calculates whether you are of legal voting age.
* Voting History: Estimates how many presidential elections you could have participated in since becoming eligible.

## How to Run the Program
1. Ensure you have the .NET SDK installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository or download the source code.
3. Navigate to the project directory using your terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the application with the following command:
   
***dotnet run***

5. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter your age and receive your voting history.

## How It Works
Upon running the program, you'll be prompted to enter your current age. The application then calculates the number of years you've been eligible to vote and estimates how many presidential elections occurred during that period. It assumes presidential elections occur every four years.

## Limitations
* This program operates under the assumption that presidential elections occur every four years without considering specific election years or your birth date's relation to election dates.
* It also assumes the legal voting age is 18, which is the standard in many countries, but may vary.
